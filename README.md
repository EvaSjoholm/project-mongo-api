## The problem
My biggest problem during this week has been understanding the different databses and how these are or can be used, if it's local or on the web and clarity in how to code the frontend with fetch method. 
Due to new programs and installing MongoDB Compass, Atlas and also adding the Cloude from previous week, this part of the backend has been hard to fully grasp. 
The endppoints creation made more sense ones the Compass become a bit clearer.
